# B101ChoirCmpVoter
This is a Python/Selenium script I wrote in a couple days to vote in a time sensitive competion that my choir was having.

VERSIONS OF THIS PROGRAM
V1: The idea here was that the script would send an HTTP request directly to their server. This ended up not working out due to a funky way the site worked.
V2: This was a "MiniMouseMacro" script, not really coding but it was my next attempt at a solution
V3: This was the first version I made using Selenium. It filled out a "fast" version of the form, and it worked!
V4: The fourth and final version which i finished halfway through the voting day for finals. Uses Selenium to fill out the full version of the form. (Fairly confident this one won us the competition!)
